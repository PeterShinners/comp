Shopping cart module
Define several simplistic shapes and modification functions to manage
the contents of a shopping cart.

Highlights:

- This entire example is built into a single print statement with a
constant at build time.
- The lower level replace has a comparison block to determine if
an existing value is in the list. The upsert wraps its comparison
in a `@once` to only replace a single value.

item = ~{name~text price~num quantity~num=1}
cart = ~{items~item{} discount~num=0}


main = (:
    {
        {"Apple" price=1.00}
        {"Banana" price=0.50 quantity=2}
        {"Apple" 1.00 quantity=2}
    }
    -> map (:> item)
    -> reduce (:> upsert (:i i.name))
    -> cart[discount=0.2]
    -> total
    -> print "Total: $()"
)


-- This helper could easily be inlined into the main pipeline
total = @val (:c~cart :pure
    c.items -> sum (:i i.price * i.quantity) * (1 - c.discount)
)


-- Upsert provided by standard libraries, but how does an implementation appear?
upsert = (:in :block.predicate=equal :block.key=pass :pure
    in.items
    -> replace[limit=1] (:> block.predicate (:> block.key))
    -> else (:> append[in.item])
)
